    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p>
      By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to
      you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
      using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part
      of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt
      to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to
      translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The
      app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and
      other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to
      TimiStudio.
    </p>
    <p>
      TimiStudio is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
      efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make
      changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
      any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without
      making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span id="appName"> App </span> app stores and processes personal
      data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s
      your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
      therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which
      is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed
      by the official operating system of your device. It could make your
      phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
      phone’s security features and it could mean that the
      <span id="appName2"> App </span> app won’t work properly or at all.
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
        The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and
        Conditions.

    <p>
      You should be aware that there are certain things that TimiStudio will
      not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require
      the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be
      Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but TimiStudio
      cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality
      if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
      allowance left.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
      remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
      provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
      mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
      while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,
      you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming
      data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
      region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the
      bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware
      that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
      using the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the same lines, TimiStudio cannot always take responsibility for
      the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device
      stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
      avail the Service, TimiStudio cannot accept responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to TimiStudio’s responsibility for your use of the app,
      when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although
      we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we
      do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can
      make it available to you. TimiStudio accepts no liability for any loss,
      direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
      functionality of the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
      available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for both systems(and
      for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the
      app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want
      to keep using the app. TimiStudio does not promise that it will always
      update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
      Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device.
      However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when
      offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
      terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to
      you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights
      and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop
      using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
    </p>
